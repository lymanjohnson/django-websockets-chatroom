Title: Real-Time Chat Application

Objective:

Create a real-time chat application using a lightweight Python web framework and WebSocket.
The application should allow users to join chat rooms and exchange messages in real-time.

Requirements:
1. Set up a web server using a lightweight Python web framework that supports WebSocket.
2. Implement a WebSocket endpoint that allows clients to connect and join chat rooms.
3. Create a simple user interface for the chat application using HTML and JavaScript.
4. Allow users to enter a username and join a chat room.
5. Display the chat messages in real-time as users send them.
6. Handle cases where users disconnect or new users join the chat room.
7. Implement a basic command system where users can perform actions like changing their
username or leaving the chat room.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Correctness and functionality of the WebSocket implementation.
2. Proper handling of chat messages and real-time updates.
3. User-friendly and intuitive chat interface (Ensure from a functional point of view, not UI)
4. Code quality

Submission:
1. Provide a GitHub repository link containing the complete source code of the project.
2. Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the chat application locally.
3. Be able to walk through the code and explain it in a follow-up interview call with the team.
